This is my linux programming course, mainly with the following highlights.

## Highlights
1. Very robust pipeline and redirection operations are supported
2. The front and back execution of the process is supported
3. The shell's built-in functions are relatively complete.
4. Clear notes

## Disadvantages:
1. In order to achieve the beauty and any combination of the above, some built-in commands create separate processes.

## Reference:
It will be available soon.

Detailed test results and document will be available soon.
